BIDIRECTIONAL VOLTAGE LEVEL SHIFTER
Based on Ti TXS0108E

http://www.ti.com/product/txs0108e
From Ti's website: 
"This 8-bit noninverting translator uses two separate configurable power-supply rails. The A port is designed to track VCCA. VCCA accepts any supply voltage from 1.2 V to 3.6 V. The B port is designed to track VCCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for low-voltage bidirectional translation between any of the 1.2-V, 1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes."

I have assambled PCBs to sell, please contact me about the details!
